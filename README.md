### scm-mmconf
This is small program that connects to ModemManager's DBus and configures modem's interface.

#### Why?
Because only program capable of communicating with ModemManager is NetworkManager which I personally dislike and which wasn't even working (ModemManager is able to connect but NetworkManager is not). With this I can use netctl and still be able to start and configure modem when I deem so.

#### Why Scheme?
Why not? Shells don't have good support for DBus, nor has Lua. Scheme was my next language of choice.

#### How to run it?
You have to install Chicken and two eggs `dbus` and `vector-lib`. To configure the interface you have to run it from root, it uses `ip` command to configure interface. Don't forget to customize the program with you system configuration.
